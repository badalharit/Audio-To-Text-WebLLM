# Audio-To-Text-WebLLM
In-browser React app for audio transcription with ONNX and WebGPU using Whisper (fully working) and Voxtral Mini 3B (experimental). Whisper uses Xenovaâ€™s ONNX weights for real-time transcription; Voxtral support is pending official JS release. Upload audio, decode in-browser, and get fast, private transcriptions without server calls.
